                    I have been working as a Full Stack Developer since December 2017 and
                    I am studying System Engineering in the National University of Tecnology (FRBA - Argentina).
                    Currently Iâ€™m doing subjects from 3rd and 4th year.
                    I am a proactive and curious person. I enjoy teamwork.
